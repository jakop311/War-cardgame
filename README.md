# War-cardgame

War - Card Game is a code I got from a book(The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally).
I thought it was boring to just copy and check if I did OK, so I tried to make a GUI version of War.

war.py is the original version.
//
warGUI.py is the code I editted.
